  - If you haven't agreed the OAuth consent screen, you have to config your settings first ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51d65e87-78c1-4d80-b6be-b76167283eb1)
  - Enable the Google Driver in the API Library ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c9bedb-b49f-4ad2-b734-3ae468e3b5c7)
  - Add your account into the test users ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d50f9916-4246-4c1d-b184-6fb324ae808b)
  - Authorize your account to this Client, Replace the CLIENT ID with yours in this URL and get the AUTHORIZATION_CODE https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&access_type=offline&include_granted_scopes=true&response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob
  - **Do not close the page** and paste the AUTHORIZATION_CODE into **get_fresh.sh**, then you will get you **Refresh Token** and **Access Token**. Please note that, the **Access Token** will be expired in 1 hour but **Refresh Token** can last long, so that's why we need update the **Access Token** while downloading.
5. For now, you've got every token you need before download from your google driver
 
## Run the download tool

1. Replace your API Tokens in download.sh
2. Replace `FOLDER_ID` with the folder/file ID, take 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nca0w_sNB5lAMY1Oh9iXvdc1K2H_AC8r/view?usp=drive_link' for example, the file ID is '1Nca0w_sNB5lAMY1Oh9iXvdc1K2H_AC8r'
